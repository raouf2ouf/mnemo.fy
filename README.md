# Menmofy: Glorified Progress Space Map (NFT as a Smart Contract)

**TLDR**: Menmofy is basically a todo app that allows you to follow the progress of your project as a space map with territories representing your progress. These maps can be minted as NFTs. However, these are not simple NFTs, they are smart contracts themselfs, allowing you to have a detailed view on you project and to create snapshots of your progress.
